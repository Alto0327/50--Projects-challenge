    <!-- REPORT
            I am slowly getting used to using raw JS even tho i didnt do much with it in here, this helped me understand how to make the hamburger menu dynamic
            just like how day 3 was supposed to be so i could go back and maybe redo it, but i still need to better understand css and its properties such as ::after and ::before 
            since i dont know how they work

            REDO: 
                - Update CSS and use After and before

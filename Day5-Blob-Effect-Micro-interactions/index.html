    <!-- REPORT
            this was Really fun and interesting since i learned more about css animation and keyframes from the past days
            i found it much easier to complete this one than the previous ones as well as it just being more simple with no js required
            however my approach was different then the Reference's with it having a greater approach on
            on individual control, which makes it offer more flexibility for styling but is more complex 
            meanwhile mine is more simple and easier to manage and understand for basic use cases

            REDO:
                - Update CSS for individual control like the reference
                - just JS

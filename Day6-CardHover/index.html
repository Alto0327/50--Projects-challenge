    REPORT
     Just like day 5 this was one of the more easier projects. However, i was stuck on the drop down of the content due to it appearing instead of sliding down. I then realized the
     reason was i was using display:none into display: block which is static causing the issue, switching to opacity fixed the problem

     REDO:
     - Refactor css
     - use JS

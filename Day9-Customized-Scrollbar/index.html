    <!-- Report
        i am currently working on my Spotify clone project and i just recently learned how to make a customized scrollbar.
        So this day was very easy, and after looking at the reference i think they even had an error in it since the img isn't loading.
        i don't think i will be redoing this day due to how simple it is.

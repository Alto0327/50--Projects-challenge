The Goal here is for 50 days Create one of these projects picked at random by chatgpt to enchance coding skills, each day will include the reference files of the project

#RULES
1. I can't look at any of the code for the reference projects and must only look at the ui/ux
2. At most a project can take up to 3 days and each day i must commit an update of the project
3. Upload to github at least once each day
